References go in here, To get a reference on scholar, Start from the search page, press the cite button (The two quotation marks, press bibtex on the format screen, your screen will go black with some white text in the top left, paste that text into here (it will look similar the one below if its correct)

Not all references have the same amount of information some have more some have less but as long as you got it from scholar or the library it will automatically format to the correct reference style for whatever type of source it is (article, book, website etc.)

They decide to throw pebbles at the hole. One girl wants to use physics to throw with the minimum speed necessary to hit the hole. What is the required launch speed v and launch angle θ above the horizontal?},
